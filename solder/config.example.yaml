  name: "my-runner"
  # Authentication token for connecting to mothership
  token: "your-secure-token-here"

# Mothership Server Configuration
server:
  # Mothership server address (HTTP or HTTPS)
  address: "http://localhost:8080"
  # Examples:
  # address: "http://192.168.1.100:8080"
  # address: "https://mothership.example.com"

# Work Directory Configuration
work:
  # Directory where tasks will be executed and files stored
  directory: "./work"
  # Examples:
  # directory: "/var/lib/solder/work"
  # directory: "C:\\solder\\work"

# Task Execution Configuration
tasks:
  # Maximum number of concurrent tasks this runner can execute
  max_concurrent: 1
  # Increase for runners with more resources
  # Examples: 2, 4, 8

# Heartbeat Configuration
heartbeat:
  # Interval between heartbeats sent to mothership (in seconds)
  interval_seconds: 30
  # Examples: 10, 30, 60

# Screen Capture Configuration
screen_capture:
  # Enable screen monitoring (automatically disabled on macOS)
  enabled: true
  # Interval between screenshots (in seconds)
  interval_seconds: 30
  # JPEG quality (1-100, lower = smaller file size)
  quality: 60
  # Maximum width for screenshots (pixels)
  max_width: 1280
  # Maximum height for screenshots (pixels)
  max_height: 720
  # Examples:
  # For higher quality: quality: 80, max_width: 1920, max_height: 1080
  # For lower bandwidth: quality: 40, max_width: 800, max_height: 600
